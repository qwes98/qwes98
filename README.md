## Hello, Makers! 👋

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm passionate about using technology to empower humans, not replace them. 

That's why my current research interest lies in **Human-Centered AI (HCAI)** and **Human-AI Interaction (HAI)**.

### 🚀 Current Endeavors
- 📘 Presently, I'm actively learning **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** and **Multi Modal AI**.
- 🛠 Concurrently, I'm trying to do some projects for AI to augment human capabilities, particularly in the fields of **education**, **collaboration**, and **decision-making**.

### 🌟 Core Expertise
- 🖥 **Full Stack Web Dev**: With 3 years as an integral part of a startup named HERD, and diverse projects tackled through freelancing, I've solidified my skills in end-to-end development, crafting solutions that effectively address real-world challenges.
