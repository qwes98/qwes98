## Hello World! 👋

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems in a way that **empowers humans, not replaces them**.

My focus is on designing and constructing **interactive systems** that prioritize user needs and experiences.

While designing, I heavily rely on the principles of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**. This involves using prototyping techniques to create and refine solutions iteratively.

### 🚀 Current Endeavors
- ⭐️ Currently, I'm exploring the exciting fields of **Human-Centered AI (HCAI)** and **Human-AI Interaction (HAI)**.
- 📘 I'm actively learning about **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** and **Multi Modal AI**.
- 🛠 Concurrently, I'm embarking on projects aimed at augmenting human capabilities through AI, particularly in domains such as **education**, **collaboration**, and **decision-making**.

### 🌟 Core Expertise
- 🖥 **Full Stack Web Dev**: With 3+ years of experience contributing to HERD, a startup, and various freelance projects, I've solidified my skills in end-to-end development, crafting solutions that effectively address real-world challenges.

### 🌌 Exploratory Interests
- I'm fascinated by the art of **hand-crafting and making**, particularly for creating physical prototypes. I believe this skill can be valuable in crafting tangible representations of interactive systems during the design process.
